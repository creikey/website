Hello blog readers! Today marks the offical end of the first day in my participation in the Weekly Game Jam, a weekly competition where game developers from all around collectively develop on a theme for a small prize. The theme for this weeks game jam was
## Boss Rush
When I saw this theme, nothing came to me at first. I even attempted at collaborating with somebody else, but our attempts at coming up with something different fell short. Eventually, I settled on the idea of a Western-based shootout game with slow bullets and moving targets. 
### The art style
In terms of art, as I was working alone, my capabilities max out at simple vector art, so that's the art style I'm going with! You can see a demo of shader on the title screen below to see what I'm talking about.

### Looking into the future
I'm not sure how much time I'll collectively have this week to work on the game jam, but I'm hoping that the end product will be a fun game and a more educated game dev(me)!
