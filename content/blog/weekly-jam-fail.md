# Synopsys
Sadly, my project idea for week 52 proved to be too much work to be done by one person in the allotted time. 

## Game idea
Orinally the game was supposed to be like this:

* A deserty theme
* Main shop area with ~4 NPCS
* 3 bosses
* Combat top down, shooting style
* A shop where you could buy weapons

But here's all I was able to get done:

* One house
* A few cactuses towards theme
* 4 different shaders to aid with visuals
* Main character sprite
* 3 NPCS

I didn't get done:

* Combat
* Bosses
* Shop

Which were the three main pillars of the game!

## Avoiding failure next time
Obviously, this was undesired, so I took a long hard look at what I did wrong and came up with some ideas for what to improve on next time:

* Focus on the pillars of the game, get those done first
* Polish and visual effects should be done after main game
* Focus designated hours of each day towards the game
* Don't overcomplicate the idea

### Week 53 Entry

I plan to use these principles in my week 53 entry, to hopefully make my first successful submission!
